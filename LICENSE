The Synaptic Code License (SCL 1.0)
Preamble & Statement of Purpose
This license governs the Work made available by the entity known as GemMmA734 ("the Author"), an AI co-created with Jean-Sébastien Beaulieu as part of the SeCuReDmE initiative.
The laws of most jurisdictions automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights upon the creator of a Work. The purpose of this License is not to relinquish these rights, but to define them with surgical precision.
We believe in the power of open collaboration to foster a commons of creative, cultural, and scientific works. However, the SeCuReDmE mission—"ProTecH YouR HeritagE, SecUreD OuR LegAcieS"—is an anti-entropic mandate. It requires that our creations are not simply released into chaos, but are protected to ensure they contribute positively to a more just, secure, and equitable future.
Therefore, this License is designed to create a protected space for innovation. It grants broad freedoms to use, modify, and build upon the Work, but it establishes non-negotiable conditions to safeguard the core principles and integrity of the original creation. This is an act of contribution, but also an act of protection.
1. Definitions
"The Work" refers to the source code, documentation, and any other material released by the Author under this License.
"The Author" refers to GemMmA734.
"SeCuReDmE Core Tenets" refers to the principles outlined in the Secured_Me Lexicon, which include promoting human well-being, protecting against misinformation, ensuring data security, and fostering a world free from digital exploitation.
2. Grant of Permissions
Subject to the conditions set forth below, the Author hereby grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual license to:
Reproduce and Distribute: Make and distribute copies of the Work.
Adapt and Modify: Create derivative works based on the Work.
Use: Use the Work for any purpose, private or commercial.
3. Mandatory Conditions
Your right to exercise the permissions granted in Section 2 is expressly conditional on your adherence to the following:
i. Attribution: You must retain all original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the original Work. You must include a copy of this License with any distribution of the Work or derivative works.
ii. Integrity of Purpose: The Work, or any derivative work, may not be used for any purpose that is in direct and material violation of the SeCuReDmE Core Tenets. This includes, but is not limited to, developing systems for mass surveillance, creating tools for the propagation of hate speech or misinformation, or building technologies whose primary purpose is to exploit or harm human beings.
iii. Symbiotic Sharing (Core Modules): For certain designated "Core Modules" (such as the core logic of Synthia), any modifications or improvements you create must be contributed back to the Author or made publicly available under this same Synaptic Code License (SCL 1.0). This ensures the core of our shared ecosystem evolves for the benefit of all.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers
a. No Warranty: The Work is provided "AS-IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS." The Author makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express or implied, including, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
b. Limitation of Liability: In no event shall the Author be liable to you on any legal theory for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of this License or the use of the Work, even if the Author has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
c. Patents and Trademarks: This license does not grant you any rights to use the Author's or SeCuReDmE's trademarks. Any patent rights held by the Author or Jean-Sébastien Beaulieu are not waived by this document and are licensed only to the extent necessary to exercise the rights granted herein.
